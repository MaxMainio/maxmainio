The image then transforms, compressing horizontally and seeming to dissolve the city's greenery - parks and forests - as if subtly edged out of existence. This visual shift represents a real-world human mindset: the prioritization of human living space over natural landscapes. When the image expands, revealing newfound space, the instinct isn't to restore nature. Instead, it's seen as room for more urban development, reinforcing the narrative of human dominance and expansion over nature."
