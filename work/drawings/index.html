							Along with my various interests in all facets of the design <i>"realm,"</i> I also enjoy drawing. From pens to pencils, from charcoal to digital styluses, I like them all. As a side hobby of mine drawing isn't something I spend an exorbitant amount of time practicing, but it's definately something I wish to get better at.
