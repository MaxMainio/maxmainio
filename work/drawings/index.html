							Along with my various interests in all facets of the design <i>&ldquo;realm,&rdquo;</i> I also enjoy drawing. From pens to pencils, from charcoal to digital styluses, I like them all. As a side hobby of mine, drawing isn&rsquo;t something I spend an exorbitant amount of time practicing, but it&rsquo;s definitely something I wish to get better at.
