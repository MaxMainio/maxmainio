						<p class="work-p">
							For this assignment, all of the juniors in graphic design were asked: How do you use text and image to tell someone’s story? How does the content, aesthetics, and tone fit into an established publication?
						</p>

						<p class="work-p">
							We all had the opportunity to reach out and interview any designer, artist, author, or person of interest and together make a newspaper style publication introducing this person and their work to the rest of the school.
						</p>

						<p class="work-p">
							I decided to Interview <a href="https://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/ed-brown" target="_blank">Ed Brown</a>, the department’s Type Shop technician and alumn of the <a href="https://dm.risd.edu/" target="_blank">Digital+Media</a> graduate program at RISD. As the technician he is <i>the guy</i> to go to with any questions regarding any of our various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing)" target="_blank">printers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotter" target="_blank">plotters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyl_cutter" target="_blank">vinyl cutters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing" target="_blank">3D printers</a>… 
						</p>

						<p class="work-p">
							As the main printer man I thought adding the <a href="https://printninja.com/printing-resource-center/printing-academy/pre-press-production/printers-marks/" target="_blank">printers marks</a> to the design would be fitting. Sadly the printers at the <a href="https://www.newspaperclub.com/" target="_blank">Newspaper Club</a> to whom we outsourced the actual printing of our publication were confused by them, so the final design we got back does not have them. The version of the publication you see here is one I made afterwards that is more inline with what I initially planned.
