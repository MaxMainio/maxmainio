    "content": "I\n\nI have lived with Shades so long,\nSo long have talked to them,\nI sped to street and throng,\nThat sometimes they\nIn their dim style\nWill pause awhile\nTo hear my say;\n\nII\n\nAnd take me by the hand,\nAnd lead me through their rooms\nIn the To-Be, where Dooms\nHalf-wove and shapeless stand:\nAnd show from there\nThe dwindled dust\nAnd rot and rust\nOf things that were.\n\nIII\n\n\"Now turn,\" they said to me\nOne day: \"Look whence we came,\nAnd signify his name\nWho gazes thence at thee\" --\n-- \"Nor name nor race\nKnow I, or can,\"\nI said, \"Of man\nSo commonplace.\"\n\nIV\n\n\"He moves me not at all:\nI note no ray or jot\nOf rareness in his lot,\nOr star exceptional.\nInto the dim\nDead throngs around\nHe'll sink, nor sound\nBe left of him.\"\n\nV\n\n\"Yet,\" said they, \"his frail speech,\nHath accents pitched like thine --\nThy mould and his define\nA likeness each to each --\nBut go! Deep pain\nAlas, would be\nHis name to thee,\nAnd told in vain!\"",

    "content": "The vestige of our relationship is mapped along these streets\nSkeletons of memories linger on the lanes you kissed me\nAciniform silk threads together all the places we’ve been\nAn inescapable web I’m trapped in\nBrighton’s buildings shapeshift into a mirror maze\nExposing the splattered guilt my hands are stained with\nYour favourite restaurants, tombstones at a graveyard I do not want to visit\nOur smiles buried beneath the cracks of these pavements\nWe created a breadcrumb trail of our fairytale love story, turned putrid\nPast your old house, across the comic shop, inside the cinema\nStumbled into the same pubs we went to\nSticky chin, cheap drink, smudged lipstick\nA useless attempt at erasing your sweet scent\nspiced vanilla, smooth tobacco and cinnamon\nLife watered-down to waiting at traffic lights\nStuck at crossroads, uncertain of where I’m going without you\nMy home was in the small space between us,\nNow the space between us is as big as this city\nAnd it’s haunted",

    "content": "I learn lots of pleasant songs at my school,\nSongs about blind mice, or stars like jewels,\nAnd animals making sounds, here and there.\nOn Macdonald Farm, sounds are everywhere!\n\nSometimes, we sing of luckless Jack and Jill.\nJack had a bad fall, strolling up Bloom Hill.\nThen there's a magic dragon, known as 'Puff',\nAnd ring a ring of roses, plunge down soft.\n\nThe song of sixpence, always great to sing,\nWith the tunes about small, ugly duckling,\nAnd dancing round the maypole, first of May.\nThen there's a muffin man, not far away.\n\nDiddle, diddle, dumpling, we sing of John,\nAnd the blue little boy, sleeping at dawn.\nI love my golden school days, full of tunes,\nSuch fun, like chasing colorful balloons!",
