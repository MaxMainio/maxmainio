							To capture as much of the activity of our chosen intersection of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@41.8256763,-71.4078145,3a,75y,26.32h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2-lpBFcXc6vKHpDBc9gxxA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D2-lpBFcXc6vKHpDBc9gxxA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D20.237528%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192" target="_blank">College st & Main st, Providence Rhode Island</a>, I recorded a 5-minute video of it from the window of a friend’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobby_loom" target="_blank">Dobby</a> studio, which looked over the entire area.
						</p>
						<p>
							From the video I was able to isolate and mask out everything that moved through the intersection. Each masked frame was then stacked on top of one another to create a tall 3D column, 5 minutes in height. The further towards the bottom of the column you looked, the further into the future you were seeing. This column gives the impression of viewing the intersection from the fourth dimension, thereby offering a unique and sophisticated insight into the dynamic nature of the intersection.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here on display is roughly a one minute chunk of the overall column.
