							<h3>By Adjacent Editors</h3>

						</div>

						<p class="interviewer">
							Adjacent Editors talk to artist and activist Heather Dewey-Hagborg about her idea-driven, research-based, cutting-edge work &mdash; the questions she asks and how she tries to answer them…from Spurious Memories, Chelsea Manning to a love virus.

						<p class="interviewee">
							Heather Dewey-Hagborg is an information and bio artist whose work explores the intersection of art, science, technology, and politics. Her palette includes data and genetic material as well as more raditional sculptural elements. She’s compelled by quintessential questions about identity, humanity, learning, creativity, and aesthetics. She approaches art as research and critical practice. Her work stuns with the precision and curiosity of a scientist and the compassion and attention to beauty and form of a visual artist. She graduated from ITP in 2007 and earned a PhD in Electronic Arts from ensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She is an artist fellow at AI Now, an Artist-in-Residence at the Exploratorium and Science Center, and an affiliate of Data & Society. She’s also a co-founder of REFRESH, a Collaborative and politically engaged platform in Art, Science, and Technology.

						<p class="interviewer">
							Let’s start by talking about your process as an artist. Where do you start? Where do you find ideas?
						</p>

						<p class="interviewee">
							All of my art starts with an idea. It differs. For “<a>Stranger Visions</a>,” I was at my therapist’s office. I noticed a hair stuck above in a glass picture frame above the couch and I wondered who it belonged to. I wondered what that strand of hair could tell me about its owner.

						<p class="interviewee">
							I was already interested in facial recognition and face generation technologies. My ITP thesis was called “<a>Spurious Memories</a>.” It was an experiment in artificial creativity. For the purposes of this project, I defined it as “the generation of an output that was not explicitly taught.” This was years before machine learning became the buzzword it is today. I designed a system that would connect a principal components analysis neural network with a self-organizing map, and I trained it on images of faces. I was inspired by Hopfield neural networks, the concept of content-addressable memories, and facial recognition algorithms.

					<div class="interview-part">
						<p class="interviewer">
							Back to “<a>Stranger Visions</a>” — you used other people’s DNA for that project without their knowledge. Is that a violation of privacy?
						</p>

						<p class="interviewee">
							Technically, yes. And I did get some criticism about it, but I wasn’t using the genetic information in a dangerous way. This was an artwork that shed light on these technologies and on the vulnerability of identity. That is, the fact that someone could use the information in an unethical way. It’s a way to draw attention to the fact that people’s’ information is not protected and could be used against them.

						<p class="interviewer">
							Can DNA really predict what someone will look like?
						</p>

						<p class="interviewee">
							To a degree. Overall, you can see how some things are easier to predict than others.  The piece I did with Chelsea Manning, where we see 30 versions, 30 possible expressions of her, addresses the unpredictability of phenotypic expression. It shows how much is up for chance when DNA is actually expressed. When it comes to phenotypes at least, you can’t know exactly how the genes will express themselves, but you can guess some things – the likelihood of the person having brown eyes and the shade of their hair and skin.

					<div class="interview-part">
						<p class="interviewer">
							Have you ever met someone you thought you had sampled from and recreated their likeness?
						</p>

						<p class="interviewee">
							Sort of, yeah. <a>Orta Therox</a> came to one of my talks. He gave away his DNA for use publicly via GitHub. Here is the photo of Orta and the image I created of him without seeing him. Not exactly a match, as you can see.<br>(You can find Orta’s DNA on his github)

							Your article “<a>Sci-Fi Crime Drama with a Strong Black Lead</a>” talks about this sort of algorithmic bias also, and the dangers of that in a police context.
						</p>

						<p class="interviewee">
							Yes, it’s about how we need a multifaceted and transdisciplinary approach blending art, science, theory, and hands-on experimentation. The media will talk about how it all works, but to fully understand, to appropriately educate others, to devise suitable policies, and to form strategies of resistance, we need to know how it breaks.

						<p class="interviewer">
							You also had a project pulled out of a show in China for being too political. Can you tell us a little about that?
						</p>

						<p class="interviewee">
							I worked on a four-channel video installation called <a>T3511</a>. It’s about a biohacker that falls in love with an anonymous saliva donor. It’s a story about my character, the biohacker, buying their saliva online, sending it to 23andMe, becoming kind of obsessed with them from their data, extracting cheek cells from their data, and growing their cheek cells on their own body (using their own bio heat to grow the other’s flesh). From then on it gets increasingly creepy.

					<div class="interview-part">
						<p class="interviewer">
							From the snippet on your website, it seems as though your character writes love letters to the donor. Is that right?
						</p>

						<p class="interviewee">
							Well, they write to me actually, because they find me through genomic social networks. It’s a personal story, but it ties into social issues. One of these social issues is around the vulnerabilities of having our genomic data in these systems. I get contacted by the donor — that’s the story in the film — because I am an exact match to the DNA I uploaded to the social genomic platform and they are looking for their relatives and so on — they don’t know that I bought their DNA and they think I must be their relative. I don’t write back to them, but since they wrote to me, I now know who they are. I look up their name and I find out where they live because they have a totally open accessible profile, about a mile away from the company that I bought the saliva from. The company is in St Louis, and I get on the train to St Louis and become a saliva donor myself as a way of getting closer to this person, sitting in the same chair they sat in, going through the same process.
