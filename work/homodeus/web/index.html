						<p class="interviewee">
							Heather Dewey-Hagborg is an information and bio artist whose work explores the intersection of art, science, technology, and politics. Her palette includes data and genetic material as well as more raditional sculptural elements. She’s compelled by quintessential questions about identity, humanity, learning, creativity, and aesthetics. She approaches art as research and critical practice. Her work stuns with the precision and curiosity of a scientist and the compassion and attention to beauty and form of a visual artist. She graduated from ITP in 2007 and earned a PhD in Electronic Arts from ensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She is an artist fellow at AI Now, an Artist-in-Residence at the Exploratorium and Science Center, and an affiliate of Data & Society. She’s also a co-founder of REFRESH, a Collaborative and politically engaged platform in Art, Science, and Technology.
