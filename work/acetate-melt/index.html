						<h1>Experimentation with rubbing alcohol & acetate prints / 2021</h1>
	
						<p class="work-p">
							While working on a school project, I began drawing on an acetate print I had. The ink I used was alcohol based which lead to part of the print corroding off of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AASl2qrJlmg" target="_blank">clear acetate film</a>.
						</p>

						<p class="work-p">
							While I used this effect in the initial school project, I also began experimenting with more prints and different methods of applying different alcohol based liquids.
						</p>

						<p class="work-p">
							This is a <i>somewhat</i> on going project. I might make more in the future.
