							<h2 id="sub-title">Experimentation with rubbing alcohol & acetate prints / 2021</h2>
							<p class="work-p">
								While working on a school project, I began drawing on an acetate print I had. The ink I used was alcohol based which led to part of the print corroding off of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AASl2qrJlmg" target="_blank">clear acetate film</a>.
							</p>
							<p class="work-p">
								While I used this effect in the initial school project, I also began experimenting with more prints and different methods of applying different alcohol based liquids.
							</p>
							<p class="work-p">
								This is a <i>somewhat</i> ongoing project. I might make more in the future.
