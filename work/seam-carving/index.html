						<h1 id="title">Seam Carving</h1>
						<h2 id="sub-title">Digital Image Processing / 2023</h2>
						<p>
							This work is part one of my three-part degree project entitled &ldquo;Techno Agriculturalism.&rdquo; My aim was to create a kind of digital art that loosely mirrors real-world events. These aren&rsquo;t precise simulations&mdash;intentionally denoted with a lowercase &lsquo;s&rsquo;&mdash;but more like artistic reflections of life, capturing its essence in visually interesting ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							I tapped into the power of a seemingly magical yet cleverly straightforward algorithm called seam carving, which is better known as liquid rescaling or content-aware scale in Photoshop, and I manipulated the impacts it has on images. Instead of the algorithm's conventional role of preserving essential content, I tweaked it to selectively remove or maintain any element of my choice. With satellite images of cities as the starting point, I applied a conservation bias favoring urban environments. At the same time, I prioritized the removal of natural areas like forests and parks.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through this digital manipulation, the piece, when compressed either horizontally or vertically, dissolves away the city&rsquo;s greenery&mdash;parks and forests&mdash;as if subtly edged out of existence. This visual shift represents a real-world human mindset: the prioritization of human living space over natural landscapes. When the image expands, revealing newfound space, the instinct isn&rsquo;t to restore nature. Instead, it&rsquo;s seen as room for more urban development, reinforcing the narrative of human dominance and expansion over nature.
