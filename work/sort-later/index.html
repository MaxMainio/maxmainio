						<h2 id="sub-title">RISD GD Senior Show / 2023</h2>
						<p class="hang-punctuation">
							&ldquo;<a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">Sort Later</a>&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s a statement, a philosophy, and the theme of the RISD GD 2023 Senior Show. In the words of our collective description, &ldquo;Design is a form of sorting...<a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">Sort Later</a> is about letting go of ideas of finality and instead celebrating the work in progress, the liminal, and the unanswered.&rdquo;
						</p>
						<p>
							My role in this graphic design journey was part of the web team. Our challenge was to translate the rich &lsquo;<a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">Sort Later</a>&rsquo; identity into a web experience that not only reflected the physical exhibition but also leveraged the unique opportunities of the digital medium. The goal was to maintain a cohesive visual and thematic link with the exhibition while allowing <a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">the website</a> to possess its unique vitality.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the innovative ways we achieved this was by creating a bridge between the web and print worlds. A distinctive feature of <a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">the website</a> is the poster generator: with a simple <kbd>cmnd</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd>, visitors can create a personalized poster or flyer. The generator populates with a custom gradient and randomly selected student work, resulting in a design that can be fitted to any media size, saved as a PDF or even printed. This web-to-print aspect provides an interactive memento of the &lsquo;<a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">Sort Later</a>&rsquo; experience, blurring the boundaries between the digital and physical realms of design.
						</p>
						<p>
							As you navigate through the <a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">RISD GD 2023 Senior Show website</a>, remember &lsquo;<a href="https://sort-later.risd.gd/" target="_blank">Sort Later</a>.&rsquo; Take your time to explore, interact, and immerse yourself in our shared journey. It might seem overwhelming, but that&rsquo;s the joy of design - the process, the discovery, and the endless possibilities. Dive in, and enjoy the process.
