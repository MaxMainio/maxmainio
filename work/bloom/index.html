						<h2 id="sub-title">Experimental Photography Postprocessing / 2023</h2>
						<p>
							During my final semester at <a href="https://www.risd.edu/" target="_blank">the Rhode Island School of Design</a>, I enrolled in a Graphic Design workshop to complete my remaining elective studio credits for graduation. This four-week workshop, &ldquo;PhotoGraphic,&rdquo; led by <a href="https://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/franz-werner" target="_blank">Franz Werner</a>, served as an introduction to the intersection of photography&mdash;particularly digital photography&mdash;and graphic design.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although I already had a background in photography &lpar;including earning a high school fine arts diploma with a project focused on <a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.com/shooting-infared-extended-red-film-guide/" target="_blank">infrared film photography</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkroom" target="_blank">darkroom techniques</a>&rpar;, this course temporarily reinvigorated my passion. Initially, I enrolled in the workshop intending it to be a light commitment, merely a means to wrap up my credits while focusing on my degree project. Yet, as the course unfolded, I unexpectedly found myself deeply immersed in a captivating exploration I hadn't anticipated
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)" target="_blank">Bloom</a>&mdash;a captivating optical lens effect&mdash;has always been a sought-after stylistic feature in various artistic disciplines. In video gaming, for instance, replicating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)" target="_blank">bloom</a> is a complex task due to the high rendering demands. This challenge piqued my interest, leading me to experiment with capturing images of reflective surfaces or intense light sources. I did this by setting my DSLR lens to its widest aperture and adjusting the manual focus as close as possible to the lens opening. The resultant images, inherently blurry and out-of-focus, were not difficult to capture. The real challenge, however, lay in isolating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)" target="_blank">bloom</a> after the fact.
