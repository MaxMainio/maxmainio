						This project wasn&rsquo;t born out of thin air; it emerged from a confluence of smaller moments and experiments. For my girlfriend Nina Rosenblum&rsquo;s birthday, in the summer of 2022, I got her a copy of the book I was currently reading: <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/" target="_blank">Yuval Noah Harari</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/" target="_blank">Homo Deus</a>,&rdquo; along with a set of colorful highlighters which I also got myself. I&rsquo;ve always been the type to keep my books in near-mint condition, while Nina enjoys the freedom to underline, fold pages, and jot notes in the margins. The highlighters served as a bridge between our two reading styles. My challenge for the both of us was to use the highlighters to venture into each other&rsquo;s reading styles. We would use the highlighters to experiment with the text as we read, creating our own systems of highlighting based on specific themes or ideas.
					</p>

					<p class="full-indent full-width">
						During our reads, one particular chapter caught both of our attention—it discussed the cultural and environmental impact of the Western lawn. While I was reminded of the <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/" target="_blank">99% Invisible</a> podcast episode &ldquo;<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lawn-order/" target="_blank">Lawn Order</a>&rdquo; and enjoyed my read about this weird human attraction to vast swathes of grass, Nina was inspired by the subject matter to create a new highlighting system. She began highlighting every occurrence of the word "lawn" in varying shades of green. It was like a little ecosystem developing right there on the pages of her book, each green highlight standing in for a patch of grass. As the chapter continued, Nina began to highlight more than just the word lawn, incorporating a wider palette of grass related words, the patches became more frequent. Some began to connect across lines of text, what began as a sporadic patch of grass here and there began to resemble an aerial view of American suburbia with more and more plots of grass all slightly different shades of green sprawling across the pages.
					</p>

					<p class="first-indent full-width">
						This idea Nina had come up with resonated with me&mdash;generative design is my forte, after all. I started mulling over ways to take her concept off the page and give it a new dimension. As great as it was to see her static highlighted words in a book convey such a feeling of life, it was begging to evolve, grow, even age. That very week I began to work on bringing this system to life. My first attempt to do so was a combination of Indesign for layout and TouchDesigner for simulating the grass. I had recently purchased an ultra-wide monitor, which when flipped 90 degrees, felt like I was staring at a towering monolith of screen real estate.
					</p>

					<p class="full-width">
						In Indesign, I started playing with a hybrid layout&mdash;part traditional book design, part modern web styling&mdash;to fit my ultra-vertical screen. As a foundation I used the content from <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/" target="_blank">99% Invisible</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lawn-order/" target="_blank">Lawn Order</a>,&rdquo; a mix of text and images that served as the substrate for my digital grass experiment. Switching gears to TouchDesigner, I tried to simulate the growth of grass. The model I initially used was adapted from another of my projects, <a href="https://maxmain.io/work/crosswalk-poetics/" target="_blank">Crosswalk Poetics</a>. Instead of pixel-based growth, like the <a href="https://maxmain.io/work/crosswalk-poetics/physical-map/" target="_blank">Moss Growth Simulation</a> in the <a href="https://maxmain.io/work/crosswalk-poetics/physical-map/" target="_blank">Physical Map</a> in that project, I scaled things up to work with broader horizontal rectangles.
					</p>


					<p class="full-width">
						Continuing I incorporated a sort of life cycle for the grass patches. Picture patches turning brown, like they&rsquo;d been scorched by the sun or neglected and under-watered. Just as in real life I was trying to create an ecosystem, so each patch&rsquo;s well-being was interconnected, meaning A patch couldn&rsquo;t easily shrivel up if it was nestled among well-watered, lush neighbors.
					</p>

					<p class="full-width">
						After a few days working on this first iteration, I felt it wasn&rsquo;t on the right path. While the simulation had promise, it felt fenced in on this static content. While it was becoming dynamic, the landscape was feeling more and more static in comparison. With <a href="https://neoscape.com/" target="_blank">work</a> and soon my senior year of <a href="https://www.risd.edu/" target="_blank">school</a> taking up more and more of my time I decided to put this project on the back burner while I focused on other things.

					<h2 class="full-indent">2<sup>nd</sup> & Current Version</h2>

					<p class="full-indent full-width">
						During the fall semester of my senior year I spent as much time as I could learning JavaScript. During the winter session, I took a <a href="https://ctc.risd.edu/" target="_blank">CTC</a> (<a href="https://ctc.risd.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Technology Culture</a>) elective studio course taught by <a href="https://www.griffinsmithart.com/" target="_blank">Griffin Smith</a>, which had an intense focus on machine learning. Although I had previous experience with many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_art" target="_blank">visual generative AI models</a> this was my first time interacting with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">large language model</a>, in this case <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank">Chat-GPT</a>.
					</p>

					<p class="first-indent full-width">
						As the spring semester got underway, my degree project began to take shape, fueled by my interest in the intersection of technology and nature. This led me to revisit &ldquo;Lawn <span class="title">Text</span>ure,&rdquo; but with a fresh, web-focused perspective. I applied for a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt" target="_blank">GPT 4.0 API key</a>, intending to use it for dynamically generating text over which the digital &ldquo;growth&rdquo; could spread. While that key never came through, my journey into JavaScript taught me the ease of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/" target="_blank">creating Chrome extensions</a>. So, that&rsquo;s the direction I took. No longer limited by an API key&mdash;or lack thereof&mdash;adapting &ldquo;Lawn <span class="title">Text</span>ure&rdquo; into a Chrome extension meant it could grow spontaneously, regardless of the website it found itself on.
					</p>

					<p class="full-width">
						This second stab at &ldquo;Lawn <span class="title">Text</span>ure&rdquo; was a hit, leading to the version you&rsquo;re witnessing unfold right now. Since it was cultivated as a part of my degree project, the focus has evolved a bit from Nina&rsquo;s initial highlighting system. My take on the concept centers on nature &ldquo;invading&rdquo; the human-centric sphere of the Internet. In line with this theme, I&rsquo;ve opted not to include a decay function for the growing elements. This way, the digital foliage feels more permanent, almost as if it&rsquo;s reclaiming space in this human-centric environment. Over time, the text&mdash;our text&mdash;becomes obscured, getting swallowed up by the &ldquo;foliage&rdquo; that takes root.
					</p>

					<p class="full-width">
						How it works is relatively simple. When a page is opened, the &ldquo;Lawn <span class="title">Text</span>ure&rdquo; script scans the DOM of the webpage for text elements. Once identified, it then combs through each of these blocks of text in search of words to seed. These seeded words will be where the digital foliage sprouts from. I have curated a large <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank">JSON</a> list of these words which the script has access to. I have compiled several versions of this list using a combo of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank">GPT 4</a>, <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/" target="_blank">Thesaurus.com</a>, and several <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/?adobe_mc=MCORGID%3DAA9D3B6A630E2C2A0A495C40%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1693929781" target="_blank">online dictionaries</a>. In one of the more experimental lists I attempted to <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2022/01/24/181-peter-dodds-on-quantifying-the-shape-of-stories/" target="_blank">quantify the &ldquo;plant relevance&rdquo; of each word</a> using how frequently each appeared in the <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/" target="_blank">thesaurus</a>. The idea was to have the digital flora grow more vigorously and be more vibrant colors around words that are more &ldquo;organic&rdquo; and then swap out to &ldquo;less organic&rdquo; synonyms and dim and fade as the plants &ldquo;decay.&rdquo;

						While part one of my degree project delves into the pervasive theme of human encroachment upon the natural, &ldquo;Lawn <span class="title">Text</span>ure&rdquo; inverts this narrative. Here, we usher in &ldquo;nature&rdquo; to an arena it has never ventured into: the exclusively human domain of the digital internet. Historically, this realm has stood as an impervious bastion of human-centric constructs&mdash;a sterile tapestry woven from deterministic and probabilistic creations, contrasting sharply with the dynamic, more-than-human world.
					</p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Lawn <span class="title">Text</span>ure&rdquo; challenges this anthropocentric paradigm. It paves the way for non-human entities, introducing subtle nuances that mimic life's spontaneity. Through highlighting segments of words, these digital proxies emulate basic life forms. Much like persistent weeds, they sprout amidst the structured confines of human design. Oblivious and indifferent to human intent, these pseudo-life forms serve their own ends, harnessing the structure of human language as fertile ground to proliferate.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this digital ecosystem, plants and flowers don&rsquo;t require rich soil or abundant sunlight&mdash;just the mere mention of them in text sparks their digital life. Seemingly innocuous word fragments become the genesis points for digital flora. From these unlikely nooks and crannies of human communication, the digital orchids and sunflowers spring to life. Their virtual roots are deeply embedded in the syntax and semantics of our language.
					</p>
					<p>
						This challenges the boundaries we've drawn between the natural and digital realms. It serves as a reminder that even in the most human-centric spaces&mdash;those carefully designed landscapes of ones and zeros&mdash;there exists the potential for more-than-human interventions.
