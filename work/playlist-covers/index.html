						<h1>Cover art for my Spotify playlists/ 2022 â€” Present</h1>
	
						<p class="work-p">
							<a href="https://zinginstruments.com/best-album-covers/" target="_blank">Album</a> covers have a long history as pieces of art and design that accompany and represent the music inside. They complement and convey the tone the musician has made with their art form.
						</p>
						<p class="work-p">
							In today's world where <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17244/us-music-revenue-by-format/" target="_blank">streaming reins supreme</a>, the vast majority of music listeners create their own playlists, compilations of their own cherry picked songs. But the visual representation of these playlists are usually left untouched.
						</p>
						<p class="work-p">
							Since January of 2022 I have been creating playlist covers for my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mliflawsee?si=e6be5bacfcae49d2" target="_blank">collection of playlists</a>. I treat each one as a little graphic design exercise.
