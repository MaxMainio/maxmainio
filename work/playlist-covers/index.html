						<h2 id="sub-title">Cover art for my Spotify playlists/ 2022 &ndash; Present</h2>
						<p>
							<a href="https://zinginstruments.com/best-album-covers/" target="_blank">Album covers</a> have a long history as pieces of art and design that accompany and convey the overall aesthetic and theme of the music within, as well as create a visual representation of the artist or band.
						</p>
						<p>
							In today's world where <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17244/us-music-revenue-by-format/" target="_blank">streaming reigns supreme</a>, the vast majority of music listeners create their own playlists, compilations of their own cherry picked songs. But the visual representation of these playlists are usually left as the default artwork provided by the streaming platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since January 2022 I have been creating cover art for my personal <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mliflawsee?si=e6be5bacfcae49d2" target="_blank">collection of playlists</a>. I treat each one as a little graphic design exercise, not only to visually convey the feel of each playlist, but also let the playlist dictate what tools or materials will drive the design process as well as what story each piece is trying to convey.
